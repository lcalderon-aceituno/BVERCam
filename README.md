# BVERCam: a software solution for biological visually equiped robots

This project consists of two parts: 
* A Flutter application 
* Arduino code 

The Flutter application is based on a project available [here](https://youtu.be/9GyOTlOGjSA), and the Arduino code is a variation of example code for the generic ESP32 camera module.
